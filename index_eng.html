						<h2> Guide to De-Google and privacy on android</h2>

					<p>This is meant to be a comprehensive guide to getting a fully de-googled android phone with as much privacy as possible, while maintaining the minimum usability and
						convenience of the device.</p>
					<figure>
						<blackquote style="color:grey">
							The guide is open to improvements and suggestions, I will describe the configuration that I find with the best usability/privacy ratio, over time I will expand the various sections introducing
							also the various alternatives for those who may not be comfortable
							with a certain app or service,
							If you want to give me advice, contribute to the guide or make translations, you can write me @turtlecute on telegram or join the telegram group that I created regarding the guide:

						<li><a href="supporto.html">Donations</a></li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<h2 id="os">Operating system</h2>
					<p>There are various android privacy oriented operating systems (GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, etc) in this guide however we will treat
						the approach using as base the LineageOS 12 (with microG) but is still compatible with any other AOSP operating system.</p>
					<h3>!WARNING!</h3>
					<p>I don't recommend this guide if you use GrapheneOS as they don't recommend rooting the device, which we will do
						(a non-rooted phone is safer because apps with root permissions can have full access to the device,
						any rooted apps in this guide are completely opensource and verified, so we can consider them safe,
						it's a compromise to have more freedom to block hidden trackers and privacy holes in the system).</p>
					<br />
					<p<>To simplify the steps for installing LineageOS I'll make a very brief summary:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Unlock bootloader</li>
							<li>Flash one recovery</li>
							<li>Flash <a href="https://lineage.microg.org/">Lineage OS </a>microG version</li>
						</ol>
						<figure>
							<blackquote style="color:grey"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter">
									Warning, the basic version without google app is preferable but using microG without adding any account
									google account we can at least use the basic services of android without going against crashes and malfunctions of app dependent
									from google play services and also receive notifications of all apps as some without play services give problems
									in notifications
							</blackquote>
						</figure>
						<p>
							At this point we will find ourselves with a device with a freshly installed operating system.
						</p>
						<h2 id="set">Editing and setup of operating system</h2>
						<p>
							To have a privacy oriented device we will start by modifying the various settings of the operating system,
							here I list the main settings and tricks even if they can change from device to device:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Disable bluetooth and localization whenever you don't use them</li>
							<li>Enable privacy in the lock screen and a method of device protection
								(hidden pins and notifications with locked phone)</li>
							<li>Disable all telemetry data</li>
							<li>Enable device encryption if disabled</li>
							<li>Disable backups</li>
							<li>Refuse, whenever possible, to share telemetry and crash data in any app you install</li>
							<li>Remember, if you use it, to disable the usb debugging (disabled by default)
								because if you lose the phone it exposes you to great risks in the security field</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We'll manage application permissions later instead.</p>
						<h2 id="magisk">Magisk,Riru and modules</h2>
						<p>We proceed with the installation of magisk, some people prefer not to root as a rooted device is less secure,
							we in this guide will only use open-source applications that we are sure can not harm us with permissions
							administrator permissions.</p>
						<p>
							Installed magisk (to be flashed in recovery) and magisk manager (apk to manage the root) we also install the following modules:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Magisk hide (will help us to hide the root from apps such as banking apps that often have blocks inserted</li>
							<li>RIRU (ART and DALVIK memory modifier)</li>
							<li>RIRU LsPosed (implementation of xposed)</li>
							<li>Systemless host (you enable it from magisk settings and it will allow us to block trackers,
								advertising and loggers in combination with other apps that we will install later)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>After rebooting the device we open LsPosed and install the following modules:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Android faker (application that allows us to change automatically or with a single click all the unique ids
								I recommend every so often (once a week/month) to open the app and click on random all to apply the new IDs.
								click on random all to apply the new IDs because occasionally does not apply them at startup.</li>
							<p>(some apps with id change may make you log out automatically (spotify and banking apps)</p>
							<li>XprivacyLUA (an app that will block the hidden permissions that apps take automatically and instead of providing the data
								instead of the data requested by them, it will provide false and random information to protect our security and privacy.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2 id="store">Store for downloading apps</h2>
						<p>Being now separated from the google world we will have to find other stores to download apps from, the main alternatives are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li> <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/">F-Droid </a> (alternative FOSS/Open Source app store) possibly we'll install apps from here but don't expect to find instagram or facebook
								to find instagram or facebook, continent only opensource apps so at most you'll find their FOSS alternatives.</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/com.looker.droidify/">Droid-ify</a>(opensource/fork alternative to fdroid with better graphics and a few more features,
								in my opinion the best alternative if you are looking for a UI a little more elegant) </li>
							<li><a href="https://files.auroraoss.com/AuroraStore/Stable/">Aurora Store</a> (it allows you to use the old google store but always through fictitious and different accounts
								each time automatically generated by him,
								I recommend that you use the guest mode / anonymous or it will be useless)</li>
						</ul>
						<h2 id="app">Fundamental applications</h2>
						<p>Now that we have the stores installed let's go download some FUNDAMENTAL and practically mandatory apps:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://adaway.org/"> AdAway</a> (it removes 90% of advertisements, trackers and loggers from browser navigation and directly from applications by acting on the host file,
								for a correct working you must have enabled the systemless host (section magisk modules is above))</li>
							<li><a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/free-app-4-0-root-airfrozen-app-freeze-package-disabler-no-root-for-samsung.3458361/">Airfrozen</a> or any app for uninstalling or disabling
								system apps (thanks to root and
								magisk we can remove the system apps that we consider unnecessary to lighten
								the system and / or share less data, I attach screen of those blocked by me, you can also block others or less depending on your use)</li>
							<p style="color:grey">Beware, block aurora services only if you enable root installation in aurora store settings.</P>
							<center><img style="width:95%; height:95%;" src="assets/img/screen.png"></center>
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/org.dslul.openboard.inputmethod.latin/">OpenBoard</a> (I make a small point about this app, it's an opensource android keyboard exactly the same as Gboard,
								I know that many are used to google board or swiftkey but for the love of god avoid them, I tried to block various processes and internet access to google board but analyzing
								the data exchanged with my network I noticed that it was still able to communicate with google servers, please use openboard or other opensource keyboards offline)</li>
							<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AppWarden/-/releases">Warden</a> (this app is a key part of the guide and blocks all app trackers and loggers on the device,
								we will discuss its use shortly)</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.bromite.org/">Bromite</a> (In my opinion the best android browser, unfortunately firefox and all its forks don't support page and cookie isolation on android,
								this creates a huge problem of privacy, bromite instead is based on chromium and even if it doesn't support extensions, it has already internally enabled an adblock that supports custom lists and
								also has various tweaks anti fingerprint)</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.myandroidtools.com/">My android tools</a> (will allow us to block services, permissions and activities of individual applications installed on our device,
								guide to 'use later in the guide)</li>
							<br />
							<p style="color:grey">At this point we can proceed to download our personal apps, surely there are apps that we will struggle to do without: social,
								banking apps, etc... I'll leave you with a list of alternatives or the most useful open source ones in my opinion:</p>
							<br />
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/com.beemdevelopment.aegis/">Aegis</a>(opensource and offline alternative to authy/google authenticator)</li>
							<li><a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod/">Antenna pod</a>(totally opensource podcast player, use as source the main existing podcast players)</li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/releases">Bitwarden</a>(best password manager, extremely secure and open source, also allows self-hosting)</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/com.pitchedapps.frost/">Frost</a>(as much as I despise and discourage the use of facebook if you just can not do without I recommend using frost,
								an opensource client for facebook)</li>
							<li><a href="https://f-droid.org/it/packages/cf.theonewiththebraid.guerrilla_mail/">Guerrilla mail</a>(open source client for guerrilla mail that is a temp mail for spam)</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/ml.docilealligator.infinityforreddit/">Infinity</a>(very good quality open source reddit client, in my opinion better than the original app!!)</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/pan.alexander.tordnscrypt.stable/">InviziblePro</a>(All-In-One app to use tor, DnsCrypt and i2p on your device, for more security or quality in the use of tor
								I recommend orbot but this one remains very convenient and efficient and more versatile</li>.
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/org.proninyaroslav.libretorrent/">Libre torrent</a>(simple, convenient and fast open source torrent client for android)</li>
							<li><a href="https://molly.im/">Molly</a>(a hardened and cleaned up google code version of signal, might be a good idea to register with a sim number bought without documents if legal in your state)</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/">Newpipe</a>(open source peertube client, all YouTube videos but without google!)</li>
							<li><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nextcloud.client/">Nextcloud</a>(Client to use and sync nextcloud, in my opinion the best softwere to make a multimedia server at home)</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.keychain/">Open keychain</a>(app to manage our PGP keys or to integrate them into messaging/email applications)</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/io.simplelogin.android.fdroid/">Simplelogin</a>(a kind of anti-spam email proxy, it creates bait emails with which to register you to sites that automatically forward emails to other
								addresses you choose, this way you don't have to give your email to external sites, also you can delete or suspend the decoy emails whenever you want so that you stop receiving emails on your main account
								main account)</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/org.telegram.messenger/">Telegram FOSS</a>(open source client for telegram that doesn't rely on google services)</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/#downloads-alpha">Tor Browser</a>(official tor browser with integrated tor library, useful to browse online without revealing your IP address, it doesn't guarantee 100% anonymity like
								every
								but it's a great shield for privacy, useful to browse .onion sites)</li>.
							<li><a href="https://github.com/Treecord/Treecord">Treecord</a>(open source and locked tracker version of the discord client for android)</li>

							<li><a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/com.simplemobiletools.filemanager.pro/">Simple file manager</a>(Open source file manager with great graphics and optional root permissions)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							For more privacy friendly applications, browsers and services i suggest to have a look at <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">privacytools</a> and <a href="https://privacyguides.org/providers/">privacyguides</a>.
						</p>
						<h2 id="email">Client and email provider</h2>
						<p>
							The discourse on which is the best email client and provider is long and complex, the best option would be to host your own email but it is not easy.
							easy.
							<br />
							<br />
							In case we want a fast and convenient service but we have to trust a third party I recommend <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-mail-android/releases">Proton mail</a>,
							to be used only via Tor, or <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.tutanota/">tutanota</a>, which seems to be a more transparent company, but claims to log users' IP addresses
							transparent, but claims to log the IP addresses of users; possibly I would avoid the use of both of these providers as they promise anonymity but already in the past they did not respect this clause and they
							they have not respected this clause and they could be honeypots(<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot" )>?</a>) but both of them auto-encrypt the messages towards the emails
							of the same provider (tutanota with tutanota and proton with proton).
							<br />
							<br />
							An option in my opinion very valid is to use as a client (so as an app on which we receive email) <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.fsck.k9/">
								K-9 Email </a> and as a provider (so as an email service to be connected to k9) or a paid service like <a href="https://email.faircode.eu/">fairemail</a> or we can try
							to contact/invite us to some privacy friendly or anarchic collective group like <a href="https://riseup.net/">Riseup</a> or <a href="https://www.autistici.org/">autistici</a>,
							the latter, however, in the past has undergone several hacks, so I recommend maybe other alternatives.
							<br />
							<br />
							Very interesting within the settings of K9 is the option of self-encryption of emails:
							By importing a PGP key from openkeychain (app discussed above) you can automatically encrypt emails to people who have imported a PGP key.
							After a first unencrypted email k9 auto imports the public key of the other person allowing us to exchange encrypted emails without having to pass keys.
						</p>
						<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">At this point of the guide you should have already installed all your
								personal applications and those I've mentioned and/or recommended, now we can go about cleaning up
								of the app tracking services on our device.</code></p>
						<h2 id="permissions">Managing app permissions</h2>
						<p>As a first step we go to our phone's settings and go to apps → advanced → permission management and here we remove any unnecessary app permissions (by unnecessary I mean that for example,
							an app like whatsapp, needs our contacts if we want to find them, so for the proper functioning of the application it's better to leave this permission, but we can safely disable access to messages as it will be used only the first time
							when we'll use it.
							as it will only be used the first time when we login to speed up the first access, after which if left active it gives whatsapp the ability to spy on all our SMS).
							<br />
							<br />
							We pay special attention to geolocation, camera and microphone permissions.
							<br />
							<br />
							When an app asks us for a permission that is not useful or you are aware that you occasionally use this service grant the permission 'just this once' so that you don't have continuous access to e.g. location.
							<br />
							<br />
							After modifying all the permissions we are also going to disable internet access to all the applications that do not need the network (for example the various file managers, calculators, diaries, notes, keyboards, etc.), we can do it
							comfortably going in the information of an application → data and network → disable 'network access'.
							<br />
							<br />
							In case you want to be further sure that these apps are blocked from the internet you can use services like AFWALL to block them behind a firewall, don't underestimate the internet access of apps, many, despite not needing
							Don't underestimate the internet access of apps, many of them, despite not needing it to work, use it all the time to share our data.
						</p>
						<h2>My Android Tools</h2>
						<p>
							This app allows us to manually go and block all the various services and activities of the apps, 'removing' small parts of the apps or blocking certain features.
							<br />
							<br />
							First of all we go to the 'service' section and through the menu at the top right click on 'search components in all apps' and search for the following words:
						<ul>
							<li><b>AdService</b> and block all services that are named exactly like this</li>.
							<li><b>Analytics</b> and block all services that contain this word <b>except</b> those of the warden application</li>.
							<li><b>Google</b> and block all services <b>EXEPT</b> those of MicroG</li>.
							<li><b>Billing</b> and we block all services in apps where we don't intend to make purchases</li>
							<li><b>Crash / report / bugs</b> and block all services that contain these words</li>.
						</ul>
						After that we go to the broadcast reciver →action →boot completed section and disable all the apps we don't want to start automatically (be careful, the apps we disable won't receive notifications while they're closed, so disable the apps
						we disable will not receive notifications while they're closed.
						closed, so disable the apps that you don't need to notice notifications right away and/or offline, leave the various messaging and email apps on).
						<br />
						<br />
						Finally, let's go to activity → top right menu → search in all components and search:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Google</b> and disable all services googleAPI except those of microG and aurora strore.</li>.
							<li><b>Facebook</b> and disable all apps where you don't need to login via facebook</li>
						</ul>
						Occasionally look to see if installing new apps has new services or activities to block.
						<br />
						<br />
						In case an app crashes at boot time, privately reactivate some of the blocked services in order to find out what's causing it to crash, and if that doesn't work either, try reinstalling it.
						</p>
						<h2>Warden</h2>
						<p>
							This app made by the same creator of the Aurora store is great for blocking all trackers quickly and automatically, Warden scans all installed apps (enable from settings the scan of system apps as well)
							and automatically blocks all trackers found (it compares them offline with the exodus privacy database, you can disable internet access to the app), occasionally like with my android tool it's worth re-scanning apps
							to block trackers of apps installed in the meantime.
							<br />
							<br />
							To block all trackers open the app, enable the system app scan in the settings, open the side menu on the left and go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'labs'</code>, then
							start the service <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'nuke it all'</code>; wait a few minutes and all the trackers found in the
							minute and all trackers found in our apps will be blocked.
						</p>
						<h2="cloud">Cloud and Vpn</h2>
							<p>
								I'm doing a little separate section for these two subtopics:
								The best cloud solution would be self hosting with nextcloud (in my opinion the best choice ), in case this is not possible the solution in my opinion easier and faster is <a href="http://mega.nz/">Mega.nz</a> (20gb free and
								5gb bandwith and accepts
								payment in bitcoin for pro plans) if we want additional security we can use a cloud with support for WebDav as icedrive in combination with <a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator</a> (program that
								encrypts files before uploading to the cloud).
								<br />
								<br />
								The VPN discourse instead is particular, a vpn theoretically encrypts our traffic and makes it pass through a node putting itself between us and our ISP so giving us privacy to it but forcing us to trust the
								vpn service itself.
								<br />
								All companies in this area promise privacy and no logging policies but virtually 99% of VPNs more than give us privacy we lose it, the only one that I really feel like recommending is <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/">Mullvad</a> (<a
									href="http://o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion/en/">onion link</a>), it is of course
								mandatory to pay in bitcoin for more privacy.
							</p>
							<h2id="conc">Final Conclusions</h2>
								<p>
									Following this guide we will have drastically reduced the sharing of personal data, this does not guarantee in any way the anonymity but only increases the privacy in the use of the device.
									<br />
									<br />
									The use of MicroG (essential if you want to receive notifications with the screen locked and want to use many non-open source apps such as banking and various social) lets a small amount of data to be sent to google servers but if
									you follow this correctly, you'll be able to send a small amount of data to google servers.
									google servers but if you follow correctly what I wrote above the data sent will be very few and not directly traceable to your account.
									<br />
									if you want to check which apps communicate with the internet and/or share your data you can use apps like <a href="https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid">PCAPdroid</a> to analyze your data traffic creating a fake VPN
									with which you filter the flow of data from your mobile phone.
									another option is to use wireshark on your PC while you are connected with your phone to wifi.
									<br />
									<br />
									other great places to stay up to date on privacy and google are various subreddits:
								<ul>
									<b>
										<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/">DeGoogle</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacyguides/">PrivacyGuides</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/">Privacy</a></li>
									</b>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<h2>Support</h2>

									If you want to support the guide with your knowledge you can contact me directly on telegram or in the group indicated at the beginning of the guide.
									To financially support the site, which has required and will require time and study, becoming a kind of patron and help with future developments and updates contact me privately on telegram or use the keys
